* Design principle
People may wonder why oh-my-github since there are alternatives([[https://github.com/magit/forge][Forge]]) exist,
here are my answer in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/z53mkb/comment/iy1lfly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][Reddit thread]]:
#+begin_quote
oh-my-github's Emacs interface require nothing but Emacs(28+), so this maybe its
one advantage(or disadvantage 🤔).

All that said, oh-my-github is not only designed for Emacs, it's designed as a generic framework for working with GitHub API.

oh-my-github's core is written in C, so other language may use it as a library via FFI, I plan to improve [[https://github.com/jiacai2050/oh-my-github/tree/master/cli][CLI interface]] in future.

Hope this explain what oh-my-github's design principle is, and why it exists besides X/Y/Z.

* Install
1. Download [[/emacs/omg.el][omg.el]]
2. Download required shared object, and rename it to =omg-dyn.so= or =dll= suffix if you are on Windows
   - From [[https://github.com/jiacai2050/github-star/releases][release page]] according to your operating system
   - or you can build it yourself with =make install-deps emacs-dyn=
3. Put above =el= and =so= files under =load-path=
4. Generate Github personal access tokens at https://github.com/settings/tokens and add it to authinfo like:
   #+begin_src
   machine api.github.com login ${github-username}^omg password ${token}
   #+end_src
5. Set github username, you can do this in two ways:
   1. Set =omg-username= variable, or
   2. Update git config by execute =git config --global github.user ${USER}=
6. Initialize with =omg-setup=

Here is a =use-package= config demo(require Emacs 30 to use =:vc= keyword):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq package-vc-allow-build-commands '(omg))

(use-package omg
  :vc (omg :url "https://github.com/jiacai2050/oh-my-github"
           :rev "v1.0.1"
           :make "emacs-dyn"
           :lisp-dir "emacs")
  :config
  (omg-setup))
#+END_SRC

After setup, you can
- Check authentication with =omg-whoami=
- Sync repositories/gists with =omg-sync=
  - =~/.emacs.d/omg.db= is the default database file, users can customize it with =omg-db-file= variable.

* Usage
There are three major-modes for repositories: =omg-repo-mode=, =omg-repo-starred-mode=, =omg-trending-mode=, and three derived modes:
- =omg-commit-mode=, commits of a repository
- =omg-release-mode=, releases of a repository
- =omg-release-asset-mode=, asset files of a release

As for gists, there are mainly two modes:
- =omg-gist-mode=, manage your ownned gists
- =omg-gist-starred-mode=,manage your starred gists

The figure below shows relations among them:

[[/assets/omg-modes.svg]]

** Useful commands
- =omg-sync= Sync repositories/gists
  - Since v0.4.0, synchronization happens in background thread, which will not hang Emacs any more. Users can check =*omg-log*= buffer for progress.
- =omg-repo-list-created=, list ownned repositories
- =omg-repo-list-starred=, list starred repositories
- =omg-gist-list-created=, list ownned gists
- =omg-gist-list-starred=, list starred gists
- =omg-trending-list=, list trending repositories
- =omg-whoami=, fetch user information
- =omg-pull-create=, create a pull request. See [[https://en.liujiacai.net/2022/11/26/oh-my-github-1-0/][this blog post]] to check details.
