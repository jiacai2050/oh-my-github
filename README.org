Oh My GitHub is a delightful, open source tool for managing your GitHub repositories.

There are mainly two user interfaces:
- Emacs. Full-featured
  - *Sync* repositories(owned and starred) list into local database
  - *Query repositories* by keyword or programming language
  - *Unstar*
  - *Query latest commits*
  - *Query latest releases*
  - *Download release asset files*
- CLI, TBD
  - *Sync*

* Features
- Support local storage
  - GitHub synchronization is only required on first use
- Support search by keyword or programming language
- Fast. Oh My GitHub's core is built in GNU99 C (tested with [[Https://valgrind.org/][Valgrind]]/[[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html][ASAN]])

* Emacs Interface
** Install
1. Download [[https://github.com/jiacai2050/oh-my-github/blob/master/emacs/oh-my-github.el][oh-my-github.el]]
2. Download required shared object, and rename it to =omg-dyn.so= or =dll= suffix if you are on Windows
   - From [[https://github.com/jiacai2050/github-star/releases][release page]] according to your operating system
   - or you can build it yourself with =make emacs-dyn=, be sure to install [[#Development][required dependencies]]
3. Put =el= and =so= files under =load-path=
4. Generate Github personal access tokens at https://github.com/settings/tokens and set it to =oh-my-github-pat=
5. Setup oh-my-github with =oh-my-github-setup=

Here is a =use-package= config demo:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package oh-my-github
  :load-path "/path/to/oh-my-github/emacs"
  :config
  (setq oh-my-github-pat (getenv "GITHUB_TOKEN"))
  (oh-my-github-setup))
#+END_SRC

After setup, you can
- Check authentication with =M-x oh-my-github-whoami=
- Sync GitHub repositories into local database with =M-x oh-my-github-sync=
  - Local database is =oh-my-github.db= inside your Emacs config directory by default, you can customize it with =oh-my-github-db-file= variable.

** Usage
There are five major-modes in Oh My GitHub:
- =oh-my-github-repos-mode=, used for owned repositories
- =oh-my-github-stars-mode=, used for starred repositories

repos/stars-mode are two main mode, there are three derived modes based those two:
- =oh-my-github-commits-mode=, used for display commits of a repository
- =oh-my-github-releases-mode=, used for display releases of a repository
- =oh-my-github-assets-mode=, used for display asset files of a release

The figure below shows relations among those mode:

- =M-x oh-my-github-sync= Sync GitHub repositories(owned and starred).
  - Emacs maybe hang a while depending on how many repositories you have.
